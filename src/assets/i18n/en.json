As the method becomes widely adopted there is one obstacle standing in the way of many operating rooms: how can one prepare more new surgeons for these challenging procedures? Training the manual and decision-making skills with the use of professional laparoscopy simulators is becoming increasingly more popular. Surgery can be thought of as a type of craftsmanship, for it to be mastered, systematic training through repetition and reflection must be performed. Experience the high level of quality and rapid improvement with the LAPARO Analytic. It is a complex training station equipped with sophisticated sensors which precisely track and analyze the position of instruments during training. With tangible results from a comprehensive scoring system and the ability to track progress on a personalized learning curve based on interactive training scenarios. You will be able to hone your skills with little need for outside assistance.",
  "analyticRightText": "Having a good vision with a certain amount of light during minimally invasive surgery is a matter of success and directly affects patient safety. There are different methodologies and preferences of what endoscopic camera angle to use and when. This is why vision tracks are available with optics angles 0° and 30°. Why not implement it to simulators to make the training closer to reality? New Analytic’s camera can be adjusted to individual preferences. Thanks to the new mechanism it is possible to choose a preferred angle before the training. This is a standard feature of vision tracks but rarely found in laparoscopic simulators, not mention of training boxes. Changing the angle of the camera allows for more diversified training. Especially, using 30°angle requires re-adaptation. We are facing here different, deeper, and more difficult perspective. Additionally, using 30° camera we get the widest possible angle during surgery. In the simulators available on the market cameras are embedded or they are using photo cameras. Very often they are permanently mounted. There is no possibility to adjust it to specific needs.",

  "introductionData.desc": "Meet LAPARO Apex - First Mixed Reality Laparoscopic Simulator by LAPARO. As a technology company, we push the boundaries of what technology can be used to improve and develop new, more effective training techniques. This is how the ambitious LAPARO Hybrid project was born to create a robust trainer for use in the most advanced medical simulation centers around the world.",
  "introductionData.title": "Hybrid Simulator",
  "introductionData.left": "Over the past decade VR has been hailed as ‘cutting edge’ and as ‘must-have’ technology for every medical simulation center. Laparoscopy simulators costing millions promised incredible results in training surgeons with realistic procedures, haptic feedback and realistic 3D models. Many simulation centers and hospitals around the world ordered these devices only to find that their training capabilities are quite limited and impractical when used in the long-term with students. 15 years forward, laparoscopic surgeons agree on the immense drawbacks of such solutions - they are simply inadequate for testing and for preparing larger numbers of young surgeons for the OR. Their capabilities are limited in size and scope and they lack the technical support and active development of exercises and programs.",
  "introductionData.right": "For the price of a single VR simulator one could equip an entire medical simulation center with diverse laparoscopy trainers and training solutions of all levels. On the other hand, basic low-price laparoscopy trainers can also be limited in capabilities. Students can develop practical skills and they can gain an adequate understanding of the forces and physical properties on these low-fidelity devices, but that can only go so far. Such trainers cannot realistically simulate complete procedures such as appendectomies and cholecystectomies. They don’t feature analytical or scoring capabilities and most importantly - they can’t teach much without the direct supervision of qualified laparoscopic surgeons.",
